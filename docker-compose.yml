# Notes:
# - Spark Job Submission:
#   The `curation_platform_job` and `feature_engineering_job` services are defined to run `spark-submit`.
#   These are one-off tasks. In `setup.sh`, it's often cleaner to use
#   `docker-compose exec spark-master spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 /path/to/job_in_container.py`
#   rather than defining separate services that run and exit.
#   I've mounted the job scripts directly into spark-master and spark-worker for this purpose.
#   The `curation_platform_job` and `feature_engineering_job` services are illustrative and can be removed if setup.sh uses `exec`.
#   I've kept `spark-master` and `spark-worker` with mounted job directories and will use `docker-compose exec` in `setup.sh`.
#
# - Trino Catalogs: `./trino_catalogs` directory will need `iceberg.properties` and `clickhouse.properties`.
#
# - Dockerfiles: For `producer_simulator` (needs kafka-python).
#   The curation and feature engineering scripts are PySpark, so they run via `spark-submit`.
#   No separate Dockerfiles are strictly needed for them if we use `spark-submit` from the Spark containers,
#   but the `build` context was in the original plan, so I've left placeholders.
#   I will generate Dockerfiles for producer_simulator, and for the Spark job runners if we decide to use dedicated runner services.
#   For now, I've assumed Spark jobs will be submitted via `docker-compose exec spark-master spark-submit ...`
#   and jobs are mounted into `spark-master` and `spark-worker`.
#
# - Superset custom drivers: `./superset_config/requirements-local.txt` will list `sqlalchemy-trino`, `clickhouse-sqlalchemy`.
#
# - Feast Image: Changed to `feast-spark` as it's more aligned with using Spark as an offline store/compute engine for Feast.
#   It should bundle Spark or be compatible with an external Spark setup.
#   Ensure `SPARK_HOME` is correctly set if `feast-spark` image doesn't bundle a full Spark distribution but relies on one.
#   The `feast-spark` image often includes Spark, so `SPARK_MASTER` and `SPARK_CONF_DIR` help it connect.
#
# - Hive Metastore S3 config: `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` and `HADOOP_AWS_S3_PATHSTYLEACCESS` added to hive-metastore for its own S3 access if needed.
#   This is separate from Spark/Trino's S3 config for Iceberg data.
#
# - Spark Job Runners: I've removed the dedicated `curation_platform_runner` and `feature_engineering_runner` services.
#   Instead, the `setup.sh` will use `docker-compose exec spark-master spark-submit ...`
#   The job scripts are mounted into `/opt/bitnami/spark/jobs` and `/opt/bitnami/spark/curation_platform_jobs` in `spark-master` and `spark-worker`.
#   This simplifies the docker-compose file. We'll need Dockerfiles for `producer_simulator` and potentially for a base python image for other services if they were not spark-submit based.
#   The `build` context for `curation_platform` and `spark_jobs` in the original plan's directory structure implies they might have their own Dockerfiles.
#   I'll create simple Dockerfiles for services that need them (producer, and if spark jobs were not submitted via spark-master).
#   For now, assuming `producer_simulator` needs a Dockerfile. `curator.py` and `feature_engineering.py` are PySpark scripts.
```

The `docker-compose.yml` has been updated with the new Iceberg-centric architecture.

Key changes and considerations:
*   **Hive Metastore (`hive-metastore` service):** Explicitly added S3 configuration (`AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`, `HADOOP_AWS_S3_PATHSTYLEACCESS`) in case Hive itself needs to interact with S3 for non-Iceberg tables or specific Hive operations, though Iceberg data access is primarily handled by Spark/Trino using their own S3 configurations (from `spark-defaults.conf` or Trino connector properties).
*   **Spark Master/Worker (`spark-master`, `spark-worker` services):**
    *   Mounts `config/spark/spark-defaults.conf` which is the core of Spark's Iceberg setup.
    *   Mounts `spark_jobs` to `/opt/bitnami/spark/jobs/` and `services/curation_platform` to `/opt/bitnami/spark/curation_platform_jobs/`. This allows `spark-submit` to be executed from within the `spark-master` container (e.g., via `docker-compose exec` in `setup.sh`).
*   **Trino (`trino-coordinator` service):** Mounts `./trino_catalogs` where `iceberg.properties` and `clickhouse.properties` will reside. These files will configure Trino's access to Iceberg (via Hive Metastore and MinIO) and ClickHouse.
*   **Feast (`feast_serve` service):**
    *   Image changed to `ghcr.io/feast-dev/feast-spark:0.36.0` to better support Spark as an offline store.
    *   Mounts `spark-defaults.conf` and sets `SPARK_MASTER` and `SPARK_CONF_DIR` to help Feast interact with the Spark cluster for materialization or offline data access.
*   **Spark Job Execution:** Removed the one-off `xxx_job_runner` services. The plan is now to use `docker-compose exec spark-master spark-submit ...` from the `setup.sh` script for running the curation and feature engineering PySpark jobs. This is a cleaner approach for one-off batch jobs.
*   **Dockerfiles:** We will still need Dockerfiles for services that are not standard images, primarily `producer_simulator`. The PySpark scripts (`curator.py`, `feature_engineering.py`) will be executed by Spark itself, so they don't need their own service Dockerfiles if submitted to the Spark cluster.

I believe this revised `docker-compose.yml` aligns well with the Iceberg architecture.

Next, I'll proceed to generate the dbt files for Trino.
